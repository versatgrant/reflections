What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When a repository is initialized, it is given a .git file with the ability to create metadata. You would need to accurately
	track different versions of the same data. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a user selected group of files that are to be commited. This allows users to choose what file/files
	are commited/tracked at any one time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	
	Only commit when a file/files when you have made a logical change, and do this for each logical change made.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches can be used when testing different experimental features of your code that isn't a direct update on the progress
	or your code. For example, creating an easy-mode in a game.
