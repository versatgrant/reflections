What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When a repository is initialized, it is given a .git file with the ability to create metadata. You would need to accurately track different versions of the same data. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a user selected group of files that are to be commited. This allows users to choose what file/files are commited/tracked at any one time.
